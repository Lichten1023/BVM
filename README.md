# BVM Virtual Machine

BVM is a small experimental bytecode virtual machine designed for learning
purposes. The project demonstrates how a simple fetch–decode–execute loop can be
implemented to run custom bytecode instructions. While the repository currently
contains only documentation, the VM's source will live under `src/` and example
programs under `examples/`.

## Architecture Overview

The VM is structured as a portable command line application. It reads bytecode
files, interprets them in a sandboxed environment and provides a minimal set of
instructions for arithmetic, memory access and flow control. The high level
components are:

- **Core interpreter**: The main loop that fetches, decodes and executes
  instructions.
- **Memory model**: Manages the stack, heap and registers used by running
  programs.
- **Assembler and tools**: Helper scripts for converting human readable
  assembly into bytecode.

## Building and Running

1. Ensure you have a C or C++ compiler and `make` installed.
2. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Lichten1023/BVM.git
   cd BVM
   ```

3. Build the project:

   ```sh
   make
   ```

4. Run the VM with a bytecode file:

   ```sh
   ./bin/bvm examples/hello.bvm
   ```

The `Makefile` will place the compiled binary in `bin/`. You can modify the
build process by editing `scripts/build.sh` when it becomes available.
